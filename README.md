# Introduction to the Practical Assignments
This repository contains the assignments and code for the Practical Assignment of the Course SOW-MKI85 Machine Hearing 2023-2024. 

This practical aims to provide you with a hands on experience with deep learning approaches for machine hearing. You will learn to pre-process audio, to extract relevant audio features, to train a ResNet-18 model on an environmental sound classification task and to evaluate the performance of the trained model.

The practical consists of six sessions. Session 1 and Session 2 introduce the assignment, the dataset, relevant concepts, frameworks, libraries, and audio feature extraction. Session 3 to Session 6 cover data preprocessing, training the ResNet-18 model on different sets of features, and evaluating and visualizing model performance.

## Intended learning outcomes
After successful completion of the practical assignments, you can...
<br>
•	Describe, extract and analyse relevant audio features for sound classification.
<br>
•	Implement a ResNet-18 model using either a single audio feature or combinations of three features. 
<br>
•	Evaluate and compare model performance for a sound classification task using relevant performance metrics.
<br>
•	Visualize data and results in a meaningful, informative way. 

# Materials
**Dataset** <br>
The dataset that we are using in this practical is the Environmental Sound Classification 50 (ESC-50) dataset[1]. This dataset consists of sound clips of 5 second duration in five categories: “Natural soundscapes & Water sounds”, “Human, non-speech sounds”, “Interior/Domestic sounds”, “Exterior/Urban noises”. The dataset is available for download here: https://github.com/karolpiczak/ESC-50.  

The link to the ESC-50 database and metafile is on Brightspace in 'Content' --> 'Practical' --> 'Dataset'.
